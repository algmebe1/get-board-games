# Get Board Games

Get Board Games is a mobile app that gathers features for every board game player, from board game database to forum, events and marketplace. CRUD is implemented in the user profile interface. Technical-wise, you will find it detailed below:

## Client-side (Front)
I used React Native Expo (using Hooks), Redux and Typescript. Firebase as authenticator and Jest for Unit Testing.

## Server-side (Back)
I developed a data model in MongoDB with mongoose. I deployed an API Rest in NodeJS with its corresponding endpoints, using NodeJS with ExpressJS. Its logic is tested using Jest.


The project is still in progress, so if you want to be up to date you can follow this repo!
